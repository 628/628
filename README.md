Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sandro, an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at the University of Michigan interested in everything from FPGA development to high-level software development.

My main passion project is [TauPau Engineering](https://github.com/taupau) where I develop interesting mechatronics and software projects to share with the world!
